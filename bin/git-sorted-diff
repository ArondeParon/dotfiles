# Diff a local file vs. HEAD, but sort first.
# This is extremely handy when diff'ing structured files (such as XML) that are automatically generated, but not always in the same order.
# Using this command, you are 100% sure to see the actual differences
diff -wB <(sort $1) <(git show HEAD:$1 | sort -)
